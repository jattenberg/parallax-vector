===============

efficient sparse and dense vector representations, primarily aimed on data needs of machine learning systems. Backed by a variety of sparse and generic collection libraries; Factories should chose the appropriate backing type based on input parameters including dimensionality, density and a emphasis on read speed, write speed, or memory footprint.
